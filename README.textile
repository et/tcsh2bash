Please note that this application is a development stage.
I'm just adding this README, so github will stop complaining to me.


h1. Tcsh2Bash

This application will read in a tcsh script and try to output the bash equivalent.

h2. Requirements

Ruby "1.9.2":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ (an older version may work, not sure)
"RubyGems":http://rubygems.org/pages/download

I recommend installing both with "rvm":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/

Additionally, you will need the following gems
treetop 1.4.8
trollop 1.16.2

h2. Usage

Inside the bin directory is an executable called "tcsh2bash".

Run it as follows

* Output to standard out: @./tcsh2bash --infile cshrc@
* Output to a file: @./tcsh2bash --infile cshrc --outfile bashrc@
